    "title": "Why are my plant's leaves turning yellow?",
    "content": "Yellow leaves can be a sign of overwatering or underwatering. Check the soil moisture first. If the soil is soggy, you're likely overwatering. If it's bone dry, it needs a drink. It could also be a nutrient deficiency, so a balanced fertilizer might help."

    "title": "How do I know when to repot my plant?",
    "content": "A good sign is when you see roots growing out of the drainage holes. Other signs include the plant looking too big for its pot or the soil drying out very quickly. It's best to repot in the spring before the growing season starts."

    "title": "What's the best way to deal with pests like gnats or spider mites?",
    "content": "For gnats, let the top inch of soil dry out completely between waterings. For spider mites, you can wipe the leaves with a damp cloth or use an insecticidal soap or neem oil. Isolating the affected plant is crucial to prevent them from spreading."

    "title": "How much light is 'bright, indirect light'?",
    "content": "This means a spot near an east-facing window or a few feet away from a south or west-facing window. The plant should get plenty of light, but the sun's rays shouldn't hit it directly for more than an hour or two, as this can scorch the leaves."
